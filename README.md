# Pollencount

Counting pollen from a slide under a microscope can be hard to learn. This simulation tool aims to help students and researchers to start to see what pollen looks like under the microscope, and start to identify common pollen grains. Some grains are more difficult than others, and this is also simulated. The user can see how well they did in identifying the pollen grains. Photos of pollen grains were found using google, but they can be replaced with other photos/databases.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a recent version of R installed (best >= 4.0.0), and have sufficient user privileges to be able to install additional R packages. 


### Installing

Within R, type the following commands:

To install the /devtools/ R package (if you haven't already done so):
```
install.packages('devtools')
```

Then load devtools:
```
library(devtools)
```

Now you should be able to install packages that are hosted on github, such as pollencount:
```
install_github('maarten14C/pollencount')
```



End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

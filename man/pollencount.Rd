\description{
Simulate the counting of pollen or other palaeoecological 'proxies'
This package is meant to facilitate learning to identify pollen or other microfossils under microscope slides. It is not a replacement of the real thing, as in counting real pollen under a real microscope, but aims to introduce students and researchers to how a slide of pollen grains could be identified. Possibly helpful therefore for on-line teaching.
